                <p class="s_indent">
                    One day, when I'm walking along the main street, I felt that there were giant dark shadow flying
                    past me. When I looked up, I was surprised to see that they were giant birds! I was really
                    frightened because it was my first time seeing them. Meanwhile, a blue cat, but with fluffy white
                    fur on her head, tail and around her waist, looking like a sheep, came over. "Ex… Excuse me…" I
                    asked. "Who are they…? Where do they come from?" My body was trembling all the time. Seeing me being
                    afraid of them that much, she laughed: "These are giant birds from the Sky Islands! You look scared…
                    Is this your first time seeing them?" I nodded. "So… Are you new to this place?" she then said, I
                    nodded again. "Well," she smiled, "there are plenty of amazing things in the Yah-Den Mainland! This
                    is just one of them. When you travel around many other places, you'll see more. By the way, I'm
                    Meimei, the dream defender!" At this moment, Meows begun gathering to the Meow Goodness statue.
                    "Looks like the show is going to start! See you later!" Then she rushed to the statue. Feeling
                    curious, I decided to take a look in the Sky Islands!
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    Now I knew that there were Sky Islands, but I don't know where are they. So I decided to find Meimei
                    again and ask her about that. I went towards the crowd in front of the statue. However, there were
                    so many meows that I can't figure out where's Meimei. I jumped over, and saw that it was a purple
                    cat that looks just like Dream Cat playing hand puppet. Her excellent skill drew my attention, and I
                    ended up watching his show until it was over. "This is Choushi performing to you, thank you all for
                    watching today." After saying this, the purple cat packed her hand puppets up and went away.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    As she goes, meows around started to disperse, and I finally found Meimei walking away. I caught her
                    and asked "So where's the Sky Islands? I'd like to go and have a look!" "Go all the way south,
                    through the meow forest, you'll see Wudons' house, those Sky Islands is on the left of it." After
                    saying them, Meimei went away.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    "Through the Meow Forest? That would be a long journey…" I thought. At that moment, I've already
                    heard of the fact that I can actually use the teleport stone in the square to warp to different
                    places. I went to the square, seeing that giant purple crystal floating on a platform. "So… All I
                    need to do is just thinking about where to go in front of the crystal?" "I want to go to Sky
                    Islands…" I whispered in my heart, walking towards the crystal, but nothing happened. "Uh… Wudons'
                    house?" Still, no responses. "…Eh?!" I started complaining, "So I must head to Meow Forest fir…"
                    suddenly, I felt that bright light started covering my body, when I responded, I found that I'm no
                    longer in the Meow Kingdom, the crystal is still here, but what were around had become a dirt path,
                    and plenty of trees.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    I was teleported to the Meow Forest.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    I sighed for the power of magic. Just then, those giant dark shadow flew passed by me again. I
                    looked up, it were those giant birds again! And I realized that they are heading to the south, like
                    what Meimei said. Without hesitation, I walked all the way to the south. About 1 hour later, I
                    walked out of the forest, sooner, I arrived at a house that looks like a lighthouse. According to
                    the sign, this must be Wudons' house. I turned my head left to see where's those islands, and I was
                    completely shocked! They are really sky islands, floating on the sky! The distance between the ocean
                    surface and the lowest area of those islands must have been more than 3000 meters, it's almost
                    impossible to head to here without special methods…
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    Just then, the door of that house was open. "Hi, is there anything wrong with you?" The meow in the
                    house said, spotted me. I turned my head to him. He was a cat with light yellow fur, but with brown
                    fur on his right ear, hands, wrist and feet, there was also a light bulb on his tail. He must be
                    Wudons.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    "Uh… Nothing." I replied, feeling confused.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    "You must have some problems! Tell me! I can help you!"
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    "Uh… Well… I want to go and take a look in the Sky Islands. But it's almost impossible for me."
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    "Ah, don't worry!" Said Wudons, "Wait for a moment!" He went upstairs, sooner, he came out with a
                    strange light bulb that looks like a wing and gave it to me. "Drop this light bulb near yourself,
                    and you'll be able to fly!"
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    "Really?" I looked at this light bulb, hesitating, and then dropped this light bulb in front my
                    feet. As the light bulb broke into pieces, I felt that there's a strange magical power flowing into
                    my body. Sooner I found that I got wings on my back!
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    "Try jumping off the cliff and fly!" Said Wudons.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    I ran to the cliff, jumped off, and tried to move my wings. And I started flying easily, as if I was
                    always able to fly!
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    "Nyahoo!!!"
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    I shouted excitedly.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    "The feeling of being able to fly is awesome!!!"
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    I was full of excitement, flying around Wudons' house. I saw Wudons smiling at me.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    "Now use your wings to fly to the Sky Islands!" Wudons shouted at me.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent">
                    "Sure! Thank you for your light bulb!!!" I replied him, then with a
                    heart full of excitement, I adjusted my position, and flew directly towards the Sky Islands…</p>
